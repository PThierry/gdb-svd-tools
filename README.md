# SVD tool in gdb

##Â Introduction

This tool handle SVD device canonical manipulation in gdb, simplyfying debugging of drivers.

SVD files are not hosted here, as they are hosted in the cmsis-svd python module

## using in gdb

An example gdb file is written, including commands to load this python module and associated
SVD file.
This example gdb configuration also handle rdp manipulation (setting RDP1/RDP2, etc.). See this
file for more information.

WARNING: this file is working on STM32F4 Flash device (using the correct magic values and sequence).
If you have a different device, verify how the RDP lock mechanism works in the datasheet first and
create a new gdb config file for this device.
